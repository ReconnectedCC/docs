# Proxies

We have a few proxies available seperate from the standard IP if you're unable to join or if the connection is unstable through the primary IP (`play.reconnected.cc`)

- `play.reconnected.cc` - Our main server hosted in Helsinki, Finland.
- `fi.reconnected.cc` - An alias for our main server.
- `us-ky.reconnected.cc` - A proxy hosted in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, USA.

To add and use a proxy, press the three dots next to the `Play ReconnectedCC` button to open the multiplayer UI

Then add the proxy as you would a regular server.

We are working on a custom UI to select proxies. This is however still a WIP.
