# Claiming
This guide shows you how to claim your land.

# Creating a claim

To create a claim, get a Golden Hoe by crafting it or running /kits and selecting the claim kit (the golden hoe).
Holding the Golden Hoe will show you the amount of claim blocks you can use.

To create a claim, right click on the first corner of the claim with your Golden Hoe, then right click on the second corner of the claim.
What you see should look like this:

<br>

Congratulations! You have now created your first claim!

# Resizing a claim

To resize your claim, get a Golden Hoe and a Stick by crafting them or running /kits and selecting the claim kit (the golden hoe).

Rightclick with your Stick where your claim is to view your claim borders.

Now, rightclick on the corner you want to move with your Golden Hoe. The corner will be changed to Lapis Lazuli to indicate you're in resizing mode.

And now rightclick where you want to move that corner to. If all went well you should have a resized claim!

# Editing properties of your claim

To edit some properties of your claim (like claim flags, or adding players), use the /flan menu command. This will pop up a menu that allows you to customize various properties of your claim.
