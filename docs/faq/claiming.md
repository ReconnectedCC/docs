# Claiming land

**This guide shows you how to manage your claims.**

## Creating a claim

To create a claim, get a Golden Hoe by crafting it or running `/kits` and selecting the claim kit (the golden hoe).
Holding the Golden Hoe will show you the amount of claim blocks you can use.

First, right-click on the first corner of the claim with your Golden Hoe, then right-click on the second corner of the claim.
What you see should look like this:

**Congratulations! You have now created your first claim!**

## Resizing a claim

To resize your claim, get a Golden Hoe and a Stick by crafting them or running `/kits` and selecting the claim kit (the golden hoe).

Right-click with your Stick where your claim is to view your claim borders.

Now, right-click on the corner you want to move with your Golden Hoe. The corner will be changed to Lapis Lazuli to indicate you're in resizing mode.

And now right-click where you want to move that corner to. If all went well you should have a resized claim!

## Editing properties of your claim

To edit some properties of your claim (like claim flags, or adding players), use the `/flan menu` command while standing on top of your claim. This will pop up a menu that allows you to customize various properties of your claim.
