# Resource packs

Our pack ships with a couple resource packs by default.

## Solar's Light Armor
[modrinth.com/resourcepack/solars-light-armor](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/solars-light-armor)
This makes player skins more visible when they are wearing armor.

## Summit's ComputerCraft Textures
[github.com/Lemmmy/CC-Jummit-Textures](https://github.com/Lemmmy/CC-Jummit-Textures)
Smoother looking textures for ComputerCraft. Intended to be in line with the style of Mojang's new textures.

This doesn't support Plethora or the new Redstone Relay.
