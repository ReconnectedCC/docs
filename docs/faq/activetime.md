# Active time

The server tracks active time for every player for Kromer welfare.

The server ignores time spent AFK, and doesn't count it on top of your activetime.

You can view your active time with the `/activetime` command. This will show you your total active time tracked.

There is also the `/activetime leaderboard` command which shows a leaderboard of the players with the most time played on the server.
