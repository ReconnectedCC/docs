# Kromer Architecture

## Wallets
Our wallets are generated serverside, and given out bound to a player.

We do not have a single central wallet we distribute wealth with, wealth distribution is done by playtime. See `Welfare` for more

There are two types of wallets:
- Personal
- Shared

You can compare the differences of the wallets in the table below:

| Wallet Type | Scheduled / recurring payments | Access ingame                | Tax (per week) |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Personal    | Send and receive               | Tied to a single player      | 0%             |
| Shared      | Send and receive               | Sharable to multiple players | 0.5%           |

## Taxes
The tax per shared wallet is 0.5%

## Welfare
Every hour a player plays on the server, the player is awarded a set amount of kromer.
