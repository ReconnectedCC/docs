# Krist api

This is the documentation for the Krist compatible api.
As the Kromer's Krist API is compatible with the Krist API, please refer to [the Krist docs](https://krist.dev/docs/), keep in mind the endpoint for the Kromer API is `https://kromer.reconnected.cc/krist/` instead of `https://krist.dev`
