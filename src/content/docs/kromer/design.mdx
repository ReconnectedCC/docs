Kromer is a toy economy server for Minecraft designed to be the spiritual successor to [Krist](https://krist.dev), with some changes to it's philosophy as well as some new features.

## Flagship Changes and Features
- **Krist API Compatibility**: Kromer is compatible with the [Krist API](https://krist.dev/docs), which means that it can be used with existing Krist plugins and services. This allows for a smooth transition for players who are familiar with Krist.
- **Decimal Currency**: Kromer uses a decimal currency system, which means that players can earn and spend money in smaller increments, down to 0.01 KRO! This allows for more precise transactions and makes it easier to manage money.
- **No Proof of Work**: Kromer does not use Proof of Work, which means it is more environmentally friendly and does not require expensive hardware to run.
- **No Cross-Server**: Kromer is not designed to be cross-server, mostly due to the impossibility to earn money on a server that it is not fine-tuned for.
- **Playtime Based**: Kromer uses a playtime based system to determine how much money you can earn, which means that you can earn money by being active on the server.
- **Player Wallets and Shared Wallets**: Kromer allocates a player wallet to each player, which is used to store their money. Players can also create shared wallets with other players, which can be used to pool money together for larger purchases or for group projects. Shared wallets are taxed.
- **Subscriptions**: Kromer allows players to subscribe to services, which allows them to earn money from the subscriptions. This is a way for players to support each other and earn money at the same time.

## Wallets
Kromer uses a wallet system to manage player money. Each player has a personal wallet, which is used to store their money. Players can also create shared wallets with other players, which can be used to pool money together for larger purchases or for group projects. Shared wallets are taxed.

<Aside type="danger">
    Player Wallets should not be used for automated access, especially in machines which you're not 100% sure you're the only one using. Regeneration of player wallet private keys is DB intensive and therefore rate-limited. Currently only Staff can regenerate player wallets.
</Aside>

## Playtime Earning (Welfare)
Kromer uses a playtime based system to determine how much money you can earn, supporters online can make everyone earn more money, but only if non-supporters are online, to make it fair.

<Aside type="danger">
Alts must opt-out of the welfare system, as they are not meant to be used for earning money.
</Aside>

### Welfare Formula
- The base earning rate is 1.50 Kromer per hour, this value is under review and may change in the future.
- For every supporter online, the earning rate increases 1.5x per hour. This value is under review and may change in the future.
- If there are no non-supporters online, the earning rate stays the same.

<Aside type="caution">
Only active players can earn money, which means that players who are AFK or not playing will not count towards the formula nor will earn money.
</Aside>

## Subscriptions and Taxes
Kromer allows players to subscribe to services, which allows them to earn money from the subscriptions.
Taxes are applied to shared wallets to prevent abuse and to encourage players to use their personal wallets for personal transactions. Under the hood, taxes are considered forced subscriptions that are paid to the server.

### Subscription Flow
1. A player creates a subscription and sets the price as well as recurring period and a suitable description(Max. 255 characters), the period can be set to any time period, but the minimum is 1 minute. A subscription is represented by an ID that is generated by the server.
1. The subscription owner can then set up websocket listeners for subscriptions, which can be used to trigger actions when a player subscribes or unsubscribes from the subscription.
1. The player can then share the subscription ID with other players, who can then subscribe to the subscription.
1. When a player subscribes to a subscription, they are charged the price of the subscription and the money is added to the subscription owner's wallet.
