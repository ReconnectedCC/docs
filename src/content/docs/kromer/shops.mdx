Kromer supports practically every Krist shop that follows the documentation on https://krist.dev/docs.
Some shops like Radon URL Encode the body and are not compatible with Kromer by default. This is an undocumented feature of the official Krist server.
Radon requires manual patching for this reason.

## Radon ([link](https://github.com/Allymonies/Radon))
<Aside type="caution">Radon requires manual patching, or use of a community fork</Aside>

The configuration for Radon should look like this:

```lua
currencies = {
    {
      pkey = "***YOURPKEY***",
      id = "kromer",
      value = 1,
      pkeyFormat = "raw",
      node = "https://kromer.reconnected.cc/api/krist/",
    },
  },
```

### Community fork ([link](https://github.com/scmcgowen/Radon))
This community fork is made by Herr Katze, and should work out of the box with Kromer: https://github.com/scmcgowen/Radon, use the install script provided in the repository


### Official fork
An official fork is in progress, it serves as a continuation of Radon entirely, not just a patch.

## yfshop ([link](https://github.com/fucksophie/yfshop))

This is a shop made by Sophie, it is still maintained

## Kristify ([link](https://github.com/Kristify/Kristify))
<Aside type="tip">Kristify works out of the box </Aside>

Kristify is an archived shop, but it will work out of the box with Kromer.
