## Perks

You will receive a colored prefix to indicate your supporter tier.

Your tier is decided by the *total* amount of money you have ever donated to ReconnectedCC. The perks are the same per tier, the tier is completely cosmetic.

| Amount Donated | Tier |
| -------------- | ---- |
| €0 - €20       | 1    |
| €25 - €70      | 2    |
| €75+           | 3    |

You can run /fly in the lobby, and use /hat and /sleep everywhere

Please note that more supporter perks are on the way.
