title: Choosing Optional Mods
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide shows you the considerations that should be made when choosing any of our provided optional mods.

Note that the optional mods have not been as thoroughly tested as our default mods, or might have some issues.

## Sodium

Sodium is a mod that improves the performance of Minecraft. It should be installed along with Indium, to provide proper rendering support for 3d prints.

<Aside>Sodium is enabled by default on the pack, as we think it is stable enough. Please report any bugs you see.</Aside>

## Iris Shaders

Iris Shaders is a mod that adds shader support to our pack. It requires Sodium (and thus Indium) to be installed.
It is not supported by Nvidium and some shader packs might not work with Distant Horizons.

<Aside>Iris hasn't been added by default as it depends on Sodium.</Aside>

## Distant Horizons

Distant Horizons is a mod that improves the client side render distance by creating LODs beyond the real chunks' render distance.
It only works with shaders built with Distant Horizons support in mind.

We have installed Distant Horizons on the server side in order to pre-render LODs for the client.

<Aside>Distant Horizons is not enabled by default due to the LOD ComputerCraft monitors not rendering their display and because it is in alpha.</Aside>
<Aside type="caution">This mod is also in alpha and may be unstable.</Aside>

## Bobby

Bobby is a mod that improves the client side render distance by caching chunks it receives from the server. It renders the chunks as real Minecraft chunks.

<Aside>Bobby is not enabled by default due to cached ComputerCraft monitors not rendering their display and because it uses a lot of storage.</Aside>
<Aside type="caution">Bobby's data is stored locally and can get very large.</Aside>

## Nvidium

Nvidium replaces the rendering backend with NVIDIA exclusive OpenGL extensions to increase fps a lot, especially with huge render distances. Sodium (and thus Indium) should be installed for this to work.
Nvidium disables itself when Iris is using a shader.

 We ship our own version of Nvidium that works with the latest version of Sodium, available [here](https://github.com/reconnectedcc/nvidium)

<Aside>Nvidium hasn't been added as it only works for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 16xx cards and newer (GeForce RTX), and because its quite an experimental mod.</Aside>
